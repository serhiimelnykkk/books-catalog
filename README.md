# Motivation

I built this project to learn:

* Task management for projects, assign, divide and complete tasks, 
learn a skill of being able to tell technical information in non-technical language

to be understanded by all types of users.
* Git workflow: dividing commits (one task - one commit), conventional commits, one feature - one branch.

# Key Learnings
* **Task Management**: I learned to divide tasks, which helped me understand tasks better and keep them written in one place instead of my head. Another part is storytelling to non-technical audience, which is crucial skill to be able to explain hard things for all types of users, which I'm currently developing.

* **Git Workflow**: I tried to simulate production git workflow, learned to write conventional commits and write changes in a one-minifeature way. Each branch is responsible for one assignment in Trello.
* **Responsive App**: Making app responsive introduced some intersting challanges, particularly to make elements scrollable and keep layout from shifts in the same time on all devices, which was solved using ```overflow``` and ```scrollbar-gutter``` CSS properties.
